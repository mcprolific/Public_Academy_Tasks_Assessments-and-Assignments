# Tules
# A tuple is an ordered, immutable (unchangeable) collection of items in Python.

# 1. Using parentheses ()
# Example 1: tuple with multiple items
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(fruits)  # ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')

# 2. Without parentheses (tuple packing)
numbers = 1, 2, 3
print(numbers)  # (1, 2, 3)

# 3. Single-item tuple (must include a comma)
single_item = ("apple",)
print(single_item)       # ('apple',)
print(type(single_item)) # <class 'tuple'>

# 4. Using the tuple() constructor
fruits_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits_tuple = tuple(fruits_list)
print(fruits_tuple)  # ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')

# Characteristics of Tuples
# 1. Ordered – Items have a fixed position.
# 2. Immutable – Cannot change after creation.
# 3. Allow duplicates – Same value can appear multiple times.
# 4. Can contain mixed data types – Strings, integers, lists, etc.
# 5. Can be nested – Tuples inside tuples.

# Ordered
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
print(colors[0])  # red


# Immutable ( uncomment and run. This will cause an error)
colors = ("red", "yellow", "blue")
# colors[1] = "yellow"  #  TypeError
print(colors[1])

# Allow duplicates
numbers = (1, 2, 2, 3)
print(numbers)  # (1, 2, 2, 3)

# Mixed data types
mixed = ("apple", 3, True, 5.6)
print(mixed)  # ('apple', 3, True, 5.6)

# Nested tuples
nested = (("a", "b"), (1, 2))
print(nested)  # (('a', 'b'), (1, 2))



# Tuple Operations
# Even though tuples are immutable, you can still perform several operations


# 1. Indexing
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(fruits[1])   # banana
print(fruits[-1])  # cherry

# 2. Slicing
print(fruits[0:2])   # ('apple', 'banana')
print(fruits[::-1])  # ('cherry', 'banana', 'apple')

# 3. Concatenation
tuple1 = (1, 2)
tuple2 = (3, 4)
result = tuple1 + tuple2
print(result)  # (1, 2, 3, 4)

# 4. Repetition
nums = (1, 2)
print(nums * 3)  # (1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)

# 5. Membership

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print("banana" in fruits)  # True
print("grape" not in fruits)  # True

# 6. Iteration
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)


# Working with Tuples

# You can’t modify a tuple directly, but you can
# Convert it to a list, modify it, then convert back.
# Use built-in functions to work with tuple contents.


# 1. Unpacking Tuples
person = ("John", 25, "Nigeria")
name, age, country = person
print(name)     # John
print(age)      # 25
print(country)  # Nigeria

# Tuple Methods
# Tuples have only two methods.
# dont count() and dot index()

numbers = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4)

print(numbers.count(2))  # 2  (counts occurrences of 2)
print(numbers.index(3))  # 3  (position of first occurrence of 3)

# Converting Between List and Tuple
# Tuple to List
t = (1, 2, 3)
lst = list(t)
lst.append(4)
print(lst)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]

# List back to Tuple
t = tuple(lst)
print(t)  # (1, 2, 3, 4)

# Built-in Functions with Tuples
nums = (4, 1, 7, 3)

print(len(nums))   # 4
print(max(nums))   # 7
print(min(nums))   # 1
print(sum(nums))   # 15
