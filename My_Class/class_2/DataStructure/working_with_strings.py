# Python data structure

# 1. String — immutable sequence of characters (often treated like a sequence)
# 2. Tuple — ordered, immutable sequence
# 3. Set — unordered collection of unique items
# 4. Dict (dictionary / map) — key → value mapping
# 5.  List— ordered, mutable sequence
# 6. Also: range, bytes/bytearray, and useful types from collections (namedtuple, defaultdict, Counter, deque)

# Single quotes
name = 'Saka Idris Ajayi'
print(name)

# Double quotes
greeting = "Hello my people"
print(greeting)

# Triple quotes (for multi-line strings)
story = '''Once upon a time, there was a coder named Ada.'''
print(story)


# String with numbers and symbols
password = "p@ssw0rd123"
print(password)
