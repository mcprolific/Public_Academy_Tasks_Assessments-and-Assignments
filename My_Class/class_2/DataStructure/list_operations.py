#====== List Operations in Python ===========
# Python lists support a variety of operations for creating, modifying, and working with data.We will go through them step by step now.
# 1. Concatenation (+)
# 2. Repetition (*)
# 3. Indexing
# 4. Slicing
# 5. Membership (in / not in)
# 6. Length (len())
# 7. Min and Max (min() / max())
# 8. Sum (sum())
# 9. List Comprehension
# 10. Copying a List






# 1. Concatenation (+)
# Joins two lists into a new list.
# Joins two lists into a new list.

list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5]
result = list1 + list2
print(result)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# 2. Repetition (*)
# Repeats elements in a list a given number of times.
nums = [1, 2]
repeated = nums * 3
print(repeated)  # [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]

# 3. Indexing
# Access elements using their position (starting from 0).
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])   # apple
print(fruits[-1])  # cherry (negative index starts from the end)

# 4. Slicing
# Extract a portion of the list.
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[1:4])   # [1, 2, 3]
print(numbers[:3])    # [0, 1, 2]
print(numbers[3:])    # [3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[::2])   # [0, 2, 4] (step of 2)

# 5. Membership (in / not in)
# Checks if an element exists in a list.
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
print("green" in colors)   # True
print("yellow" not in colors)  # True

# 6. Length (len())
# Counts the number of elements in a list.

items = ["pen", "book", "laptop"]
print(len(items))  # 3


# 7. Min and Max (min() / max())
# Returns the smallest or largest element.
nums = [5, 2, 9, 1]
print(min(nums))  # 1
print(max(nums))  # 9

# 8. Sum (sum())
# Adds all numerical elements in a list.
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(sum(numbers))  # 10

# 9. List Comprehension
# Creates a list in a single line.
# This should be familiar already, right?

squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
print(squares)  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]

# 10. Copying a List
# Create a duplicate list.
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a.copy()  # or b = list(a)
print(b)  # [1, 2, 3]
